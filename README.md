# Theme_Clock
JavaScript code for a dynamic clock implementation on a web page. The code utilizes the transform property to rotate clock hands (hour, minute, and second) based on the current time. The rotation angles are calculated using the scale function, mapping time values to appropriate angles for a visually appealing clock display.
